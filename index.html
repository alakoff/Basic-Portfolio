                Hi, there. Thanks so much for checking out my portfolio.
                But first a little snippet about myself.
            </p>
            <p>
                I live in the Short Pump area, and am married to Lisa, a surgical nurse at Henrico Doctors,
                and have one beautiful daughter, Lindsey. My daughter is getting married in May of 2019, so
                if anyone wants to start a Go Fund Me page, that would be much appreciated. Oh, almost forgot
                the most special member of our family, Belle. She's a 13 year old English Springer Spaniel.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, I work at Capital One as a developer and analyst. I am writing scripts using languages
                like Bash, Python, Visual Basic and JavaScript. I am really looking forward to completing
                the Bootcamp and becoming a Full Stack Devloper. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Normally, I don't really like spiders. I do like the University of Richmond Spiders.
                Go Spiders !
